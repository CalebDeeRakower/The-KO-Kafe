    <title>Welcome to the KO Kafe!</title>

    <h1>What is the KO Kafe?</h1>
<p>The KO Kafe is just what it sounds like! A restaurant which doubles as a fighting club run by your friendly local underground organization! (don't question the legality of this location, you might have more problems on your hands if you do.) On the menu, you can find many combat based food, such as the infamous Knuckle Sandwich. If you don't want to eat, you can instead volunteer as The Entertainment.</p>
<h1>"What is the Entertainment?" You ask?</h1>
<p>The Entertainment is the fighting arena itself of course! When you volunteer to be a fighter, you first have to sign a waiver showing that we are in no way responsible if you get hurt or meet your untimely demise. Once you sign and are all ready to fight, you simply enter the ring! Please note that only 2 people can be in the ring at the same time, and there are only 2 rules: no weapons and no attacking the audience. Audience, you needn't worry, we have our highly trained security guards to protect you. If you win your battle, you can either choose to drop out and take your winnings, or continue on a streak, where each victory will multiply your winnings by 1.5. The fee to enter is $50 and your prize for winning your first match is $100 and a free meal. (Note:  this does not mean you get more free meals if you win multiple matches in a row). </p>
<h2> Come on in to The KO Kafe, where you can eat, drink, and fight! Just don't fight on a full stomach or you'll regret it!</h2>
